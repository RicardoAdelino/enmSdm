# enmSdm

This package is a complement to the popular **dismo** package by Robert Hijmans. Its primary feature is a set of calibratuin functions for commonly-used species distribtion modeling algorithms all named with the prefix "train" like `trainGlm()`, `trainMaxEnt()`, and so on. It also has several functions useful for evaluating models including the `geoFold()` function which defines geographically distinct k-folds, `aucWeighted()`, `contBoyce()`, `Fpb()` for calculating AUC, the Continuous Boyce Index, and Fpb, respectively.  Several functions help in pre-processing data and bias correction including `elimCellDups()` for eliminating duplicate points in raster cells, `geoThin()` and `geoThinApprox()` for geographically thinning points, `longLatRasters()` for making longitude and latitude rasters, `mop()` for calculating mobility-oriented parity (a measure of multivariate distance), and `sampleRast()` and `sampleRastStat()` for sampling rasters with/out replacement and possibly in a stratified manner.  Finally, several function are helpful for evaluating niche overlap, including `compareNiches()`, `compareResponse()`, and `randGeoBySelf().
